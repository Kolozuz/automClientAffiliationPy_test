The objective of this repository is to create an automatization algorithm with Python and Selenium that can help us speed up our data creation process and overall the groups efficiency, feel free to propose ideas/tips/improvements trought github's feature "Issues" (for order sake) or in our daily meetings

### Disclaimer

This is a small project, a sort of first step into automatization with python, and it is not meant to be something too big, the whole purpouse of this is to get some experience that will allow us to explore better alternatives (scalability, performance, practicality etc.)
